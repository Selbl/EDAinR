Exploratory data analysis of the [Supermarket Sales database from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales) using R and Jupyter Notebooks.

My code includes: data formatting, working with date objects, data visualization, heatmaps, scatterplots, frequency plots and regression analysis. I mainly consider three questions: 

1. What drives the purchased quantity?
2. What drives the total purchased amount?
3. What drives the rating that customers give based on their experience?

Every step of the code is commented and the rationale for the way I do certain procedures is described when possible.
